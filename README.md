# Snapbot
A snapchat batch bot

# About
This project is made up of two very simple batch scripts. It automates the process of opening and sending snaps.

# How to use
If you want to use the batch scripts, then you will need to have ADB in your PATH and have your phone connected to your PC via a cable capable of data transfer. It is also likely that you will have to manually calibrate the batch scripts screen tap locations as we probably have different screen sizes.

To use the snap send batch file, first go to the contact you will be sending the snaps and then hide the keyboard. After calibrating the script, just open the batch file and watch it run.

To use the snap open batch file, first connect go to the conversations list in Snapchat. After calibrating, open the script and watch it run.
